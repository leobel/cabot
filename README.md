Once you have a gmail account (you can create one here: <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp" target="_blank">https://accounts.google.com/SignUp</a>), next step is allow communication between Cabot Submitter and your gmail account. First you need to create a project in Google that use Gmail API, follow this link: <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=gmail&amp;pli=1" target="_blank">https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=gmail&amp;pli=1</a>  and create a new project. After you create the project it will say that the API is enable, now you need to set the right credentials, so click in the button (go to credentials). Next step is set up your project, you will see something like this:
